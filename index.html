            <h2>Working From Home and the Centrality Premium: Implications for Business Districts</h2>
            <p>This paper provides a first empirical analysis of the intracity effect of Working From Home (WFH) on business districts using a novel dataset on commercial real estate and covering the period up to 2022. Taking advantage of the Covid-19 crisis as a natural experiment and implementing a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that WFH has already led to a modest but significant rise in office vacancy in the Paris metropolitan area. This effect is stronger the further away from the centre, indicating the firms' strong preference for the fundamentals offered by centrality in this new environment, and highlighting the widening spatial disparities between business districts at the expense of suburban areas due to teleworking. This paper further explores the possible indirect effect of WFH on local consumption services as another implication for business districts and reveals that WFH exposure has been associated with a significant decline in employment in the retail sector at the local level.</p>
